# Hamburger Menu Overlay

[Demo Site](https://xboudsady.github.io/hamburger-menu-overlay/)

Hamburger menu, in CSS only. No JavaScript is used. The menu will create an overlay when click and is page responsive.

Traditionally, to achieve this feature; it is often handled by JavaScript which will handle  click event to trigger classes that will show or hide the element.

Instead, we are using the checkbox, in which we can style the `checked` state. We will taking advantage of pseudo class, and element state properties.
